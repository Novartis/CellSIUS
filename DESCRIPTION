Description: CellSIUS enables the identification and characterization
    of (rare) cell sub-populations from complex scRNA-seq datasets: 
    it takes as input expression values of N cells grouped into M(>1) 
    clusters. Within each cluster, genes with a bimodal distribution 
    are selected and only genes with cluster-specific expression are 
    retained. Among these candidate marker genes, sets with correlated
    expression patterns are identified by graph-based clustering.
    Finally, cells are assigned to subgroups based on their average 
    expression of each gene set. The CellSIUS algorithm output provides the 
    rare/ sub cell types by cell indices and their transcriptomic signatures.
